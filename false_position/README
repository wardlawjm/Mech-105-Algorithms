This is a Matlab code for implementing the false position method to find the root of a function. The code takes as inputs the function to 
find the root of, the lower and upper bounds of the interval to search for the root, the desired relative error (es), the maximum number 
of iterations (maxit), and any additional parameters that may be needed by the function. The code then iteratively narrows down the interval and 
estimates the root of the function using the false position method.

The while loop in the code updates the lower and upper bounds of the interval based on the function values at those bounds, and calculates 
the estimated root using the false position formula. The code then checks if the estimated root is the exact root (i.e., the function value at the 
root is zero), and updates the approximate relative error accordingly. The loop continues until the desired relative error is achieved or 
the maximum number of iterations is reached.

Finally, the code returns the estimated root, the function value at the root, the approximate relative error, and the number of iterations taken 
to converge to the root.

Example usage:
To find the root of the function f(x) = x^3 + 4*x^2 - 10 on the interval
[1, 2] with a desired relative error of 0.001:
