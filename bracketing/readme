Inputs:

g: the acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2.
mu: the coefficient of friction between the surface and the object.
F: the force applied to the object in N.
m: the mass of the object in kg.
x: a vector of angles in radians to be evaluated.

Outputs:

angle: the angle that solves the problem.
fx: the function value at the solved angle.
ea: the bisection error estimate.
iter: the number of bisection iterations.

Description:

Bisection uses a series of splitting the interval in half to find where the line crosses the X axis. Goes until the error is small enough to call a number that you are looking for.
